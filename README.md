Junior frontend technical test using React for Colillas Branding

# REACT

I decide to create a second version of the project using React because it offers efficient rendering and easy maintenance for complex applications. Although this is not a complex app, creating it in React using components will ensure the scalability, code reuse and maintainability.


# Installation

You need to install node modules:

```
npm install
```

# Structure

On the *index.css* we have the formatting and the fonts we need for the project.

On the *App.jsx* is where we load all of our components.

We have an *assets* folder just like the other project where we have all the images we are going to be using.

Inside the *src* folder, each component has its own folder with its own css.
